1.  Explain the differences between `client-side routing` and `server-side routing`.

Client side routing is when the route is handled internally by the JavaScript that is loaded onto the page. When a user clicks on a link, the URL changes but there's no request to the server. The page's state just changes. Server side routing is when a user clicks on a link, and the page sends a request to the server. A whole new document is then served to the user.
